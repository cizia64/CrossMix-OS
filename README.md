# Introduction

CrossMix-OS is based on TrimUI stock firmware with a more advanced configuration,
new emulators and new tools to offer an optimal experience on your TrimUI Smart Pro.

CrossMix-OS is also designed for the community, developers and creators: it supports themes, icon packs, background packs, template for "Best" collections, overlays auto config, â€¦

All components of CrossMix-OS are free and open source.

# Installation & Update

**To make a fresh install:**
- Format your SD card in FAT32. (use a genuine, name-brand SD card and not the stock one sold with your console)*
- Download the [latest release of CrossMix-OS](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS/releases/latest) (in the "assets", at the bottom of the release page, look for "CrossMix-OS_v1.x.x.zip")
- Extract the archive to the root of your formatted SD card.
- Copy your BIOS files into the `BIOS` folder (on stock SD card copy it from `RetroArch/.retroarch/system` to `BIOS` folder)
- Copy your own ROMs into the `Roms` folder (or copy the `Roms` folder from stock SD card, rom path changes : PPSSPP -> PSP , OPERA -> PANASONIC , PICO8 -> PICO)
- Insert your SD card into your TrimUI Smart Pro and boot the console.

*Recommended SD card size is at least 128GB for the firmware, emulators, BIOS files and ROMs.

**To update**, the process is almost the same : 
- Run chkdsk/fsck on your SD card first (as there are many bad SD cards, it's always a good idea to check for errors)
- Extract the contents of the new archive on the root of your SD card, overwriting all existing files.

**Remark:** CrossMix-OS doesn't require any firmware update before installation: it will guide you to update it if required, just let yourself be guided on the first boot.

**Remark:** CrossMix-OS use the firmware 1.0.4 hotfix 6 by default (no need to update it before your CrossMix installation), hotfix 9 is also supported but boot logo change is disabled.

# FAQ

- **My TSP resumes a crashed game**: Press the Menu button during the entire boot time.
- **PSX bin files not displayed**: Use the Cue generator in System Tools to generate `.cue` files.
- **Disabling overlays**: Use the "Overlays" tool in System Tools to disable overlays for all emulators in one click.
- **Overlay settings issue**: If the max ratio overlay isn't found, the pixel perfect overlay will be used instead.
- **Device doesn't boot, black screen**: Press the power button for 10 seconds and try again. Restore the default boot logo if necessary.
- **PSX gamepad configuration issues**: Use the "PSX Analog detector" for correct configuration.
- **Current game is frozen**: Press Menu and Power for 3 seconds to force exit the game.
- Retroarch configuration ovverides: CrossMix OS uses "directory overrides" everywhere. This is the best choice : in many handhelds OS it works with core overrides but this has no sense as some cores are used for multiple platforms. 
So Directory override is a nice choice but there is an enormous limitation : when you have rom subfolders (for example "GBA/modern games") Retroarch will look for a "modern games" override instead of "GBA" override, fortunately this limitation is managed in CrossMix-OS thanks to [FolderOverrideFinder.sh created by Schmurtz](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS/commit/49faff09c4cf30534cc722cc53a309db3a78be3b).

# Some words from the author

I'm Cizia, a passionate retrogamer. I love the TrimUI Smart Pro, but I felt it deserved a more mature OS, better configured, and with more options. I worked tirelessly to create an image that meets my standards, and today, I'm sharing it with you.

There are some features I'm particularly proud of, such as:

- **Background and icon selectors**: it completes well the native theme selector.
- **Overlay selector**: Configure your default display ratio and overlay in one click for all platforms, plus new dedicated overlays.
- **SwanStation 16/9 mode launcher**.
- **Extensive work on emulator launchers and configuration**.
- **Default customization of the OS**: custom theme, icons and backgrounds, Polish language added and many new tools.
- **Firmware Update Wizard**: an automatic guide to help user to update if necessary.
- **Best packs standardization**: generic launcher, game shortcuts support and images on folders.

I would also like to extend a warm thank you to Kloptops for [PortMaster and his tools](https://github.com/kloptops/TRIMUI_EX) which are deeply used in CrossMix-OS.

Thanks to Schmurtzm for his numerous scripts, I have revised and integrated them into CrossMix-OS, which have greatly enhanced the available features:
- [PSX Analog Detector](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/blob/main/SystemTools/Apps/SystemTools/Menu/EMULATORS/PSX%20Analog%20Detector.sh): Detects PSX games compatible with analog sticks and automatically sets the correct controller configuration.
- [BootLogo](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/Bootlogo): An app for easy boot logo flashing on TrimUI Smart Pro.
- [EmuCleaner](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/EmuCleaner): An app to display only emulators with ROMs installed.
- [System Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/SystemTools): An app to centralize different apps/scripts in one place.
- [Resume at Boot](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/ResumeAtBoot): A set of scripts to add a resume game on startup feature.
- [Subfolder config override finder](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/12021#issuecomment-2107300989) is also used in CrossMix-OS.


I hope CrossMix-OS will become a reference among OSes based on the stock OS and continue to improve with community support.
