# Introduction

CrossMix-OS, the OS which elevates your TrimUI Smart Pro to new heights. 

CrossMix-OS uses TrimUI Stock user interface with refined configurations, new features, new emulators and new apps. There are so many differences that CrossMix can be considered an dédicated OS in its own right.

Designed with the community in mind, CrossMix-OS caters to developers and creators alike. It supports a wide range of customizations, including themes, icon packs, background packs, templates for "Best" collections, and automatic overlay configurations.

As a completely free and open-source platform, CrossMix-OS invites you to explore, contribute, and customize to your heart's content.

# Some words from the author

I'm Cizia, a passionate retrogamer. I love the TrimUI Smart Pro, but I felt it deserved a more mature OS, better configured, and with more options. I worked tirelessly to create an image that meets my standards, and today, I'm sharing it with you.

There are some features I'm particularly proud of, such as:

- **Background and icon selectors**: it completes well the native theme selector.
- **Overlay selector**: Configure your default display ratio and overlay in one click for all platforms, plus new dedicated overlays.
- **SwanStation 16/9 mode launcher**.
- **Extensive work on emulator launchers and configuration**.
- **Default customization of the OS**: custom theme, icons and backgrounds, Polish language added and many new tools.
- **Firmware Update Wizard**: an automatic guide to help user to update if necessary.
- **Best packs standardization**: generic launcher, game shortcuts support and images on folders.

I would also like to extend a warm thank you to Kloptops for [PortMaster and his tools](https://github.com/kloptops/TRIMUI_EX) which are deeply used in CrossMix-OS.

Thanks to Schmurtzm for his numerous scripts, I have revised and integrated them into CrossMix-OS, which have greatly enhanced the available features:
- [PSX Analog Detector](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/blob/main/SystemTools/Apps/SystemTools/Menu/EMULATORS/PSX%20Analog%20Detector.sh): Detects PSX games compatible with analog sticks and automatically sets the correct controller configuration.
- [BootLogo](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/Bootlogo): An app for easy boot logo flashing on TrimUI Smart Pro.
- [EmuCleaner](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/EmuCleaner): An app to display only emulators with ROMs installed.
- [System Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/SystemTools): An app to centralize different apps/scripts in one place.
- [Resume at Boot](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/ResumeAtBoot): A set of scripts to add a resume game on startup feature.
- [Subfolder config override finder](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/12021#issuecomment-2107300989) is also used in CrossMix-OS.
- [Scraper](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/Scraper): an app to automatically download boxarts.


I hope CrossMix-OS will become a reference among OSes based on the stock OS and continue to improve with community support.
