Playball Sample Data
====================

The Sony game cartridge Playball has a built in ROM with samples that are
replayed during the game. Also the game Hardball (by Sony) can use these
samples, when it detects the Playball ROM in the second cartridge slot.

Due to copyright reasons, we cannot distribute these samples with openMSX.

If you have the samples (in WAV format), you should put them in this directory,
with the following file names:
  playball_0.wav
  playball_1.wav
  ...
  playball_14.wav

(Note that playball_0.wav and playball_5.wav are the same sound, you do need to
provide them both though.)

If you want to have real fun, provide your own samples instead of the original ones!
