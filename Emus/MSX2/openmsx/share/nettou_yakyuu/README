The Jaleco game cartridge Moero!! Nettou Yakyuu '88 has a built in ROM with
samples that are replayed during the game.

Due to copyright reasons, we cannot distribute these samples with openMSX.

If you have the samples (in WAV format), you should put them in this directory,
with the following file names:
