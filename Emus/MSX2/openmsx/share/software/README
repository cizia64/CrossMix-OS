This directory is the default file pool for software (i.e. not system ROMs). If
you put your software here (e.g. ROM images), openMSX will find them if they
are used in a replay or savestate you are trying to load, if they have the
right sha1 sum, i.e. if they are exactly the right ROMs. The file name is
irrelevant.
