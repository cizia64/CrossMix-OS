Console Options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At startup, the mupen64plus program will look for a user configuration file
called 'mupen64plus.cfg'.  If this file does not exist, it will be created and
default settings will be written. If desired, an alternate config directory can
be specified using the --configdir commandline option.

Run 'mupen64plus --help' for a complete list of commandline options: 

 $ mupen64plus --help

Cheats
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To list the available cheats in the rom:

mupen64plus --cheats list "/path/to/my/rom.v64"

If there are cheats in the rom, you will get (in the output console):

UI-Console: 3 cheat code(s) found for ROM 'MY ROM'
   0: [Enable All Levels] (This is needed to be able to Play all Levels of the Game)
   1: [Enable All Weapons] (This is needed to be able to Play with all Weapons of the Game)
   2: etc...

All you have to do to use this cheats is:

mupen64plus --cheats 0,1,2 "/path/to/my/rom.v64"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugger
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup
=====

You must use a mupen64plus core library which was built with the DEBUGGER flag set.

Running
=======

Use the --debug command-line option to enable the console debugger.

The emulator mode should be set to "interpreter", as the dynarec seems to cause
issues when interacting with the debugging API. This can be done with the R4300Emulator
config setting or with the --emumode flag.

Usage
=====

Once the emulator boots, it will be paused by default. You will be presented
with a prompt as follows:

(dbg) 

The following commands can be entered:

run
  Unpauses the game.

pause
  Pauses the game.

step <num-steps>
  When paused, instructs the emulator to make a single step, or a series of
  steps if num-steps is provided.

regs
  Prints out general purpose register values.

pc
  Print current value of Program Counter register

pc-1
  Print previous value of Program Counter register

asm
  Print assembly language instructions. Several forms are supported:

  asm                     Print one instruction at the Program Counter register

  asm <addr>              Print one instruction at <addr>

  asm <addr> <n>          Print <n> instructions starting at <addr>

  asm <addr> <n> <flags>  Print <n> instructions starting at <addr> with flags
    - If flags bit-3 is set (i.e. & 0x04): also print binary instruction data
    - If flags bit-2 is set: prefix each instruction with its memory address
    - If flags bit-1 is set: prefix each instruction with a counter from <addr>

mem
  Print memory values. Several forms are supported:
  
  mem <addr>        Print one 32-bit word at <addr>
  
  mem /N <addr>     Print <N> 32-bit words at <addr>
  mem /Nb <addr>    Print <N> 8-bit bytes at <addr>
  mem /Nh <addr>    Print <N> 16-bit half-words at <addr>
  mem /Nw <addr>    Print <N> 32-bit words at <addr>
  mem /Nd <addr>    Print <N> 64-bit double-words at <addr>

  mem /NxM <addr>   Print <N> rows of <M> 32-bit words at <addr>
  mem /NxMb <addr>  Print <N> rows of <M> 8-bit bytes at <addr>
  mem /NxMh <addr>  Print <N> rows of <M> 16-bit half-words at <addr>
  mem /NxMw <addr>  Print <N> rows of <M> 32-bit words at <addr>
  mem /NxMd <addr>  Print <N> rows of <M> 64-bit double-words at <addr>

write
  Write values to memory. Several forms are supported:

  write <addr> <value>    Write a (1) byte value to <addr>

  write <addr> b <value>  Write a (1) byte value to <addr>
  write <addr> h <value>  Write a half-word value (2 bytes) to <addr>
  write <addr> w <value>  Write a word value (4 bytes) to <addr>
  write <addr> d <value>  Write a double-word value (8 bytes) to <addr>

translate
  Translates virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. Memory
  read/write breakpoints must operate on physical addresses, in contrast to the
  memory read/write commands and execution breakpoints that operate on virtual
  addresses.

  translate <virtual address>  Print the 32-bit physical address for the
                               provided <virtual address> argument.

bp add
  Adds a breakpoint at a given address. Several forms are supported:

  bp add pc                  Add a breakpoint at the Program Counter, triggered
                             on EXEC, READ, and WRITE.

  bp add <addr>              Add a breakpoint at <addr>, triggered on EXEC,
                             READ, and WRITE.

  bp add <addr> <n>          Add a breakpoint starting at <addr>, extending <n>
                             bytes, triggered on EXEC, READ, and WRITE.

  bp add <addr> <n> <flags>  Add a breakpoint starting at <addr>, extending <n>
                             bytes, with specified trigger flags.
    - M64P_BKP_FLAG_READ = 0x02
    - M64P_BKP_FLAG_WRITE = 0x04
    - M64P_BKP_FLAG_EXEC = 0x08

bp trig
  Prints the reason for the most recently activated breakpoint trigger. Memory
  read/write breakpoints will indicate the hit address.

bp rm <addr|index>
  Removes a breakpoint by address or number.

bp list
  Lists all breakpoints.

exit|quit
  Stop emulator and quit debugger

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64DD Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some compatibility with the 64DD disk drive unit has been implemented, but there
are a few small usability issues of which users should be aware.

When using the 64DD, you need to pass a path to a cartridge rom, even if none is
strictly required.  The IPL boot rom will execute first and select the disk if
you have one inserted, or just show the boot menu otherwise.  We can remove this
requirement at a later time. For now all we need to remember is to use a Japanese
ROM (otherwise some region check will fail) with same features as the 64DD game
you want to play (think RumblePak, TransferPak, otherwise, they won't be available).

There is a sibling issue also with 64DD games in that there are no entries in the
game db (mupen64plus.ini) for them, and the core currently only relies on the cart
ROM loaded to fetch the ROM infos.
